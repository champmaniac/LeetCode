<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful/">2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given two positive integers <code>n</code> and <code>target</code>.</p>

<p>An integer is considered <strong>beautiful</strong> if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to <code>target</code>.</p>

<p>Return the <em>minimum <strong>non-negative</strong> integer </em><code>x</code><em> such that </em><code>n + x</code><em> is beautiful</em>. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make <code>n</code> beautiful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 16, target = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 467, target = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> 33
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 1, target = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.
